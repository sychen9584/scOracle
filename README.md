# ðŸ”® scOracle: An AI Assistant for Single-Cell Analysis

**scOracle** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to answer questions about single-cell data analysis using LLM-powered search over curated documentation. It integrates tools like LlamaIndex, Qdrant, and Streamlit to deliver fast, context-aware assistance grounded in real-world biological tooling and workflows.

## Features
- Target audience: Scientists or students navigating single-cell workflows
- Ingests real docs, notebooks, and repo source code
- Responds to natural language questions (e.g., "How do I run Leiden clustering?")
- Offers code snippets, parameter guidance, and troubleshooting tips based on ingested knowledge
- Modular backend: ability to swap models and tune parameters

## Tech Stack

|---
| Component | Choice | Function 
|:-:|:-:|:-:
| LLM API | GPT-4o mini | Generates natural language responses conditioned on retrieved context
| Retrieval | LlamaIndex | Manages document ingestion, chunking, indexing, and context retrieval for RAG
| Embedding | all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (SBERT) | Converts text into dense vector representations for semantic search
| Vector DB | Qdrant | Stores and retrieves embeddings efficiently to support fast similarity search
| UI | Streamlit | Provides a simple, interactive web interface for user input and chatbot output

## Future improvements for scOracle
1. Scaling up the knowledge base
2. Improve document chunking strategy
3. Decouple backend and frontend services
4. Adapter-based fine-tuning or embedding optimization
